            OUR STORY

        </h4>
        <p>
            The joke is always the same.  After a few too many homebrews, you begin to wonder why you can’t do this for a job.  And like so many of our friends, we too began on an ale inspired night, on a college balcony, on one of Boulder’s perfect summer nights.

            But what started out as a passing thought grew into our very humble Open Door Brewing Company.  We have always loved our beer enough to share with our friends, and we hope you feel just the same.  Remember to always <b>Beer Happy!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Open Door Brewing Company was founded by our slightly crazy head brewer, <b>Andy Riedel</b>.  He somehow convinced his cousin, <b>Billy McDivitt</b>, and good friend, <b>Mikey Badaracca</b>, to join him in this endeavor.  Together, they hope to share their craft with you, and hopefully bring you a little bit of happiness each time.

            <b><i>Cheers!</i></b>
